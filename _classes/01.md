        <p>Welcome to Mars Radio Cyber Arts Camp. We are very excited to have you join us. From now on we’ll be calling you Martians. Today we will get you oriented on the tools we’ll be using and have you get started on the first steps to building your very own solar powered light sculpture.</p>
        <p>Prior to beginning the course you will receieve a <strong>terraform kit</strong>. All tools you will need to complete the missions is provided in your kit. Let's take a look at what's in your kit ! If any items are missing, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:info@mars.radio">info@mars.radio</a> ASAP and we'll be sure to send over the missing items lickity split.</p>
        <p>Everyday on Mars begins with a clean workspace. To achieve this, remove all clutter besides the supplies you will need for the days mission.</p>
        <p>Each lesson is divided into sections.</p>
        <p>Now that you are up to speed with the course architecture, lets blast off to mars !</p>

What is it called ? What does it look like ? Think about its characteristics ~ What is the topography like ? Describe the demographics, ecosystem, culture, flora, fauna, and beyond. Are there beings that walk its surface ? Is it solid ? Tell us story about it’s origin. These are only a suggested handful of ways to begin describing your planet, with many many more that I encourage you to explore. Let your imagination grow with the limitless possibilities of planetary creation. Write down your story.</p>
